			I really enjoyed working on this assignment and found it to be quite useful in familiarizing myself with various mobile responsive web technologies. Within the guidelines of the assignment, I used pieces from both assignment 5 and assignment 6 in order to create a basic website that included elements of responsive design for mobile devices.
			</p>
			<p>
			Responsive Design as it relates to this assignment is our ability as programmers to ensure that the design of our website can facilitate a variety of screen sizes. The design also needs to respond to the actions of the end user, for example, adjusting the width of their browser. In my research I discovered that there were many approaches to responsive design, and that there isn’t necessarily one best approach. In fact, the “best” approach is constantly changing as browsers and devices change. An approach that might be a standard today, isn’t necessarily a standard five years from now. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Web pages can take advantage of responsive design techniques in order to ensure that the end user has the best experience possible regardless of the device they use to access that web page. Some of these technologies involve using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to detect the current screen size of the end user. Once detected, the web page can take advantage of that information by presenting the user with a page layout tailored for their device and/or screen size.
			</p>
			<p>
			My approach to responsive design for this assignment involved using concepts from CSS Grid Layout and @media CSS. The CSS @media allowed me to specify the size of screen I wished to make a design for. The CSS Grid layout allowed me to specify where and when I wanted certain grid elements to appear within a specific @media size. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For this design, I kept a very basic CSS Grid layout, and only tailored the @media screen size queries to a generic mobile device and regular desktop view, as per requirements. In the future, I would want to better familiarize myself with CSS Grid such that I could take advantage of the technology further. I would add additional @media queries such that these designs would apply to a greater variety of screen sizes. I would also consider familiarizing myself with something like bootstrap such that I could take advantage of pre-existing mobile responsive technologies without handwriting it from scratch. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Moving forward, I would not build a store front as I built it for this submission. In assignment 5 I had the storefront contained within a table, but for this assignment I moved each cell in the table to its own grid element in order to make it more flexibly responsive. As this final assignment was intended for us as students to research, I wanted to test my abilities to manipulate various grid elements in a responsive setup “by hand”. Moving the cells of the table to a nested grid allowed me to practice making a nested grid, and it allowed me to explore different layout options as the screen size changed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Writing this from scratch was a very informative lecture on the power and flexibility of these tools. If I were to write this again such that the website was more re-usable and flexible, I would write a JavaScript to produce all the repeating elements of the table. I would attempt to use DOM to modify the CSS as well. Because those concepts were covered in previous workshops, I did not make that my focus here.
